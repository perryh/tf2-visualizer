This plugin was designed to give players a feel for the climate and play-style of a tf2 server.  It allows people to see what is happening in a tf2 server from their web browser, in case the server is full or they would like to spectate a competition. Our visualization has two major components: “Live Spectator visualization” (the motivation being to bring some of the live action right into the visualization) and “Social Trends visualization” (the motivation being to analyze trends that build up over time)
<br><br>
The data is gathered from the <a href="server12.tf2newbs.com:27015">tf2Newbs 24/7 Dustbowl</a> server.
<br><br>
The server-side logging plugin was written by <a href="http://gamespotting.net/">RogueDarkJedi</a>.
<br><br>
The graphs are made with the <a href="http://grafico.kilianvalkhof.com/">Grafico</a> javascript library. It includes functions from <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphaël</a> and <a href="http://prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a>.
<br><br>
The live-streaming backend was created in Ruby with the <a href="http://sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> web application framework. The data-analysis scripts were written in PHP.
